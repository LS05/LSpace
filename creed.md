**As of 25 July 2018**

I want to share with you what I stand for, why I'm doing what I'm doing, so people know about it. (And they know why I'm not a crazy person too).

The creed is a description of what I stand for, my values, and goals.

This can change in time.

Is good for me too, so to have a journal-like experience and log it as it changes.

I want to walk you through my life.
        
I want to inspire people living better lives. Lives that they only imaging to live. I want to be a better person than I'm now. I believe people are not just the job they have, but everything they represent and give.

We are a process.

I'm a creative and I don't like conventional things.<br>I don't like comfort.<br>Taking risks, living a life anyone feels impossible to live and help people with or without of my craft.

I believe in self-improvement and day-to-day learning.

The goal is to learn from life, and give away as much as possible to help and inspire.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andria">My hometown</a> is a place where a lot of young people are struggling with their dreams. Is a place where refugees cannot make a living.<br>Is the place where the most important people of my life are living.

How can I help them? By let them know about the opportunities they can have by learning. We're living in a time where the Internet has all the learning opportunities. Learning english and know about this opportunities, would open up to a different life.

Is the place where my family is living.<br>I want to be there for them, and I want them to finally overcome their struggles and limitations, that life has had for them so far. I want them to feel free and stop suffering.

Loyalty.

Loyalty is what represents me. No matter what, no matter the place, I'm loyal to my values, to my goals, and to the people I love. Friends, family they are part of me, and I'm thankful to them to be part of my life.<br>I'll be loyal to them while they let me live this journey.
