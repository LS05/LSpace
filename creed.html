        <strong>As of 25 July 2018</strong>
        <p>I want to share with you what I stand for, why I'm doing what I'm doing, so people know about it. (And they know why I'm not a crazy person too).</p>
        <p>The creed is a description of what I stand for, my values, and goals.</p>
        <p>This can change in time.</p>
        <p>Is good for me too, so to have a journal-like experience and log it as it changes.</p>
        <p>I want to walk you through my life.</p>
        <p>I want to inspire people living better lives. Lives that they only imaging to live. I want to be a better person than I'm now. I believe people are not just the job they have, but everything they represent and give.</p>
        <p>We are a process.</p>
        <p>I'm a creative and I don't like conventional things.<br>I don't like comfort.<br>Taking risks, living a life anyone feels impossible to live and help people with or without of my craft.</p>
        <p>I believe in self-improvement and day-to-day learning.</p>
        <p>The goal is to learn from life, and give away as much as possible to help and inspire.</p>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andria">My hometown</a> is a place where a lot of young people are struggling with their dreams. Is a place where refugees cannot make a living.<br>Is the place where the most important people of my life are living.</p>
        <p>How can I help them? By let them know about the opportunities they can have by learning. We're living in a time where the Internet has all the learning opportunities. Learning english and know about this opportunities, would open up to a different life.</p>
        <p>Is the place where my family is living.<br>I want to be there for them, and I want them to finally overcome their struggles and limitations, that life has had for them so far. I want them to feel free and stop suffering.</p>
        <p>Loyalty.</p>
        <p>Loyalty is what represents me. No matter what, no matter the place, I'm loyal to my values, to my goals, and to the people I love. Friends, family they are part of me, and I'm thankful to them to be part of my life.<br>I'll be loyal to them while they let me live this journey.</p>
